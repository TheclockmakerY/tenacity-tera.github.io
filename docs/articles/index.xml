      <description>Been working on translating website into few more languages out of convenience for everyone. Main languages which made were picked are russian and korean - which you can see on the main Homepage under the [Language Selection].
If there would be volunteers to translate into other languages;for example German or Spanish I wont be against adding those as well.
That being said Im also looking for translators who would help our translating the content of the website, contact me on Discord if youre interested ðŸ‘‹</description>

      <description>First article! Yay! Website was released while still work in progress.
 I believe that many of the dungeon guides will be useful already while the website is in development.  This website is still under development. Some articles will not be available to view.</description>
