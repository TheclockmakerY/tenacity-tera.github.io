If there would be volunteers to translate into other languages;for example German or Spanish I wont be against adding those as well.
That being said Im also looking for translators who would help our translating the content of the website, contact me on Discord if youre interested 👋

<pre><code>[Important] Last Goodbyes

Through the time, many efforts were made to make Arborea peaceful.
Deep gratitude and reverence for Guardians who made their sacrifice.

To say a final goodbye to the Guardian, many gathered. 
Say goodbye to your friends who grew with you first.
Then please come here for the last time.
I'll be waiting for you in Velika.


Click to accept the quest.
If you accept the quest, the &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; item disappears.
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>After accepting, you will have to travel to the <strong>Memorial of Elleon Kubel</strong> located in Velika.</p>
<pre><code>Memorial of Elleon Kubel
When I looked at his memorial, 
So many memories came to my mind of us together.
Our first meeting was hostile...
... but he could trust and rely on improvement.

He was an ally.
May his soul have a good rest.
</code></pre>
<center>
<p><em>- Jelena walks up to you -</em></p>
</center>
<pre><code>Jelena
I thought I could meet you here.
I'm so grateful to see you again in front of his memorial.
We three together... did a lot of work.



Jelena

I had a hard time letting him go.
I didn't know I'd say goodbye like this.
There were a lot of hard times while I was with you.
I think there were a lot of things that were worthwhile and happy.
I'll never forget you and Kubel for the rest of my life.
</code></pre>
<center>
<p><em>- Reply that Jelena is right. -</em></p>
</center>
<pre><code>Jelena

I'm going to say goodbye with other people, but...
I've been waiting for you.
I wanted to meet you first in a quiet place.
Because I thought you'd see him before you leave.

I wish you happiness.
May adventure and happiness always be with you wherever you go.
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cg6BW5K.png" alt="">
Afterwards, you will have to travel to the <strong>Memorial of Payesyn and Shiozu</strong> located in Pora Elinu.</p>
<pre><code>Little Elin
Standing here, I'm going to share a happy past and a sad present...
That's what I think.. and the future that awaits us...
What will it be?

May Seren is great to me, to our Popori, and to you. Bless you.



Little Elin

Farewell guardian.
The work of Shiona and Shiozu.. I owe you a lot of things.

Thank you so much, Guardian.
By the way, what brings you to Pora Elinu?
</code></pre>
<center>
<p><em>- Reply that you came to commemorate Paesyn and Shiozu. -</em></p>
</center>
<pre><code>Little Elin

You came to commemorate Shiozu and Paesyn..
Why don't you plant a tree for them?
I'll give you a seedling here.
Please plant it in the garden outside.
They will feel your heart and be happy.
</code></pre>
<center>
<p><em>- Receive seedlings and plant it to the garden outside Pora Elinu -</em></p>
</center>
<pre><code>The branches are swaying in the wind.
Paesyn and Shiozu soul were greeted in peace.


Memorial of Paesyn and Shiozu
Shiozu was cold and chilly, but her will was strong.
Paesyn was ingenuous but zealous in everything.

When you look at them...
They smile on their own during every difficult mission.
If only it hadn't ended in tragedy...
Their souls forget all the pain and solitude.

May the happiness be with you.



Shiozu and Paesyn would be so grateful if they knew you came.
I will remember you for the rest of my life.
I wish you peace everywhere.
</code></pre>
<center>
<p><em>- Wish her to stay well. -</em></p>
</center>
<hr/>
<p>Afterwards, you will have to travel to the <strong>Memorial of Hasmina and Helen</strong> located in Allemantheia.</p>
<pre><code>Memorial of Hasmina and Helen
Hasmina, who was with me on the mission until the end...
My heart aches for her cruel fate.
Helen... her sister, resurrected by Dakuryon's hands as a subject.
Hasmina died at Helen's hands.

If you didn't let your guard down and stopped Dakuryon,
There wouldn't have been a tragedy like this.

I will never forget them.
</code></pre>
<center>
<p><em>- Quietly pay your respect. -</em></p>
</center>
<pre><code>Fraya

I thought youd stop by here.
Im glad you were the guardian of Arborea.

Did you say goodbye to Hasmina?
Well, to say goodbye all of a sudden.. I don't know what to say.
A lot of things happened. It was not once or twice that... 
... Arborea overcame a crisis thanks to you.

I really appreciate it.
</code></pre>
<center>
<p><em>- Reply that you were only doing your job. -</em></p>
</center>
<pre><code>Fraya
No matter where you go and what you do in the future...
... you will be good at it.

May the God Karas accompany you on your way.

Are you going to Highwatch now?
Tell me when you're ready. I'll send you there.

</center>
<p><strong>Jelena:</strong> You&rsquo;re leaving now? <br>
Thank you. Even though there were hard times, we could overcome them all because you were with us.<br>
Thank you so much.</p>
<center> 
<p><em>-People begin to march in-</em></p>
</center> 
<p><strong>Seir:</strong> We heard that you were leaving. <br>
It&rsquo;ll be a long journey, so how about we say farewell before you go? Guardian.</p>
<p><strong>Kaia:</strong> You are my sword. <br>
Though we will now stand on different battlefields from one another, I will remember you forever.</p>
<p><strong>Tamur:</strong> I see your steps are waivering, looks like you&rsquo;re still not over us!</p>
<center>
<p><em>-The elves appear with their magic-</em></p>
</center>
<p><strong>Fraya:</strong> Some things, even magic can&rsquo;t make easier. <br>
Facing farewell, that is.</p>
<center>
<p><em>-Mystel appears-</em></p>
</center>
<p><strong>Mystel:</strong> Chosen One, <br>
Though our fate is to go on separate ways, remember that our hearts will always be with you.</p>
<center>
<p><em>-Cheering and fireworks. Velik appears-</em></p>
</center>
<p><strong>Velik:</strong> Now, you&rsquo;re ready to go on a long journey, Chosen One. <br>
It is thanks to you that Arborea could make it this far. <br>
Though we go our separate ways now, the courage and the determination you have demonstrated, in not giving up. <br>
We shall always remember. <br>
We&rsquo;ll cheer for you to stand and continue. <br>
As you make journey in the new world that lies ahead of you. <br>
Thank you for everything, our hero.</p>
