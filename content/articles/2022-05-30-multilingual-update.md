<hr/>

Been working on translating website into few more languages out of convenience for everyone. <br> 
Main languages which made were picked are **russian** and **korean** - which you can see on the main Homepage under the **[Language Selection]**.

If there would be volunteers to translate into other languages;for example German or Spanish I wont be against adding those as well.

That being said Im also looking for translators who would help our translating the content of the website, **contact me** on Discord if youre interested ðŸ‘‹

**This website is still under development. Some articles will not be available to view.**
