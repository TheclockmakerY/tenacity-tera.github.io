Naslow maps are a random drop from dungeons that allow you and up to a party of five people to go to a location and get some loot. The maps have a duration of 3 hours from the time of their pickup so you should keep an eye on your inventory for maps. <br> 
They cannot be traded but they can be stored in a guild bank and other people with guild bank access can take them out.
