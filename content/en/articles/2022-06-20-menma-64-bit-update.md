<hr/>

The transition to 64-bit is almost complete. The 64-bit testing environment will be going public for a few days to check for potential issues and bugs with it.<br>
Everyone will be able to access the **64-bit test server** by downloading the 64-bit launcher and game client from the link in downloads section on [Menma’s Discord](https://discord.gg/menmastera)

You can use your existing account to connect to the server and you will be having your current progress from the main server. However the main and test servers are not synced so you will only have the progress you have made up to this day.<br> Afterwards the progress on test will be not be changed based on your progress in main server and vice-versa.

**DO NOT delete the existing game**, this will be a different client. **You cannot access the main server with this client.**

*Side note:* Proxy and ShinraMeter are not configured for this server yet so they will not be functional for now. <br>
*Side note 2:* Includes patch 1.1 changes as well.
