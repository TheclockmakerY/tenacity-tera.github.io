<hr/>

If you access the Korean servers by 30th June, you can play Last Quest, created by the BHS as a final Goodbye before the live servers officially shut down.<br>
It was confirmed that **Gameforge** (EU,NA,SEA publisher) will **NOT** be releasing this questline themself. <br>
As of writing, they only released translated cutscene from last part of the series of quests.

But honestly, their translated version is as cheap as it can get...
* **You can view translation by clicking** [HERE](#last-quest-cutscene-translation)
* Original version of only last cutscene can be viewed at :

Reuploaded to prevent it from being deleted in the future.

    [Important] Last Goodbyes

    Through the time, many efforts were made to make Arborea peaceful.
    Deep gratitude and reverence for Guardians who made their sacrifice.

    To say a final goodbye to the Guardian, many gathered. 
    Say goodbye to your friends who grew with you first.
    Then please come here for the last time.
    I'll be waiting for you in Velika.


    Click to accept the quest.
    If you accept the quest, the "Last Goodbye" item disappears.

After accepting, you will have to travel to the **Memorial of Elleon Kubel** located in Velika.

    Memorial of Elleon Kubel
    When I looked at his memorial, 
    So many memories came to my mind of us together.
    Our first meeting was hostile...
    ... but he could trust and rely on improvement.

    He was an ally.
    May his soul have a good rest.

*- Jelena walks up to you -*

    Jelena
    I thought I could meet you here.
    I'm so grateful to see you again in front of his memorial.
    We three together... did a lot of work.


    
    Jelena

    I had a hard time letting him go.
    I didn't know I'd say goodbye like this.
    There were a lot of hard times while I was with you.
    I think there were a lot of things that were worthwhile and happy.
    I'll never forget you and Kubel for the rest of my life.

<center>

*- Reply that Jelena is right. -*

</center>

    Jelena

    I'm going to say goodbye with other people, but...
    I've been waiting for you.
    I wanted to meet you first in a quiet place.
    Because I thought you'd see him before you leave.

    I wish you happiness.
    May adventure and happiness always be with you wherever you go.

Afterwards, you will have to travel to the **Memorial of Payesyn and Shiozu** located in Pora Elinu.

    Little Elin
    Standing here, I'm going to share a happy past and a sad present...
    That's what I think.. and the future that awaits us...
    What will it be?

    May Seren is great to me, to our Popori, and to you. Bless you.



    Little Elin

    Farewell guardian.
    The work of Shiona and Shiozu.. I owe you a lot of things.

    Thank you so much, Guardian.
    By the way, what brings you to Pora Elinu?

<center>

*- Reply that you came to commemorate Paesyn and Shiozu. -*

</center>

    Little Elin

    You came to commemorate Shiozu and Paesyn..
    Why don't you plant a tree for them?
    I'll give you a seedling here.
    Please plant it in the garden outside.
    They will feel your heart and be happy.

<center>

*- Receive seedlings and plant it to the garden outside Pora Elinu -*

</center>

    The branches are swaying in the wind.
    Paesyn and Shiozu soul were greeted in peace.


    Memorial of Paesyn and Shiozu
    Shiozu was cold and chilly, but her will was strong.
    Paesyn was ingenuous but zealous in everything.
    
    When you look at them...
    They smile on their own during every difficult mission.
    If only it hadn't ended in tragedy...
    Their souls forget all the pain and solitude.

    May the happiness be with you.



    Shiozu and Paesyn would be so grateful if they knew you came.
    I will remember you for the rest of my life.
    I wish you peace everywhere.

Afterwards, you will have to travel to the **Memorial of Hasmina and Helen** located in Allemantheia.

    Memorial of Hasmina and Helen
    Hasmina, who was with me on the mission until the end...
    My heart aches for her cruel fate.
    Helen... her sister, resurrected by Dakuryon's hands as a subject.
    Hasmina died at Helen's hands.
    
    If you didn't let your guard down and stopped Dakuryon,
    There wouldn't have been a tragedy like this.
    
    I will never forget them.

<center>

*- Quietly pay your respect. -*

</center>

    Fraya

    I thought youd stop by here.
    Im glad you were the guardian of Arborea.

    Did you say goodbye to Hasmina?
    Well, to say goodbye all of a sudden.. I don't know what to say.
    A lot of things happened. It was not once or twice that... 
    ... Arborea overcame a crisis thanks to you.

    I really appreciate it.

<center>

*- Reply that you were only doing your job. -*

</center>

    Fraya
    No matter where you go and what you do in the future...
    ... you will be good at it.

    May the God Karas accompany you on your way.
    
    Are you going to Highwatch now?
    Tell me when you're ready. I'll send you there.

<center>

*- Reply that you are ready. -*

</center>

Clouds of flower pellets are flying through the air and Elins are bowing to you,saying that they will miss you.

Thank you so much.

**Seir:** We heard that you were leaving. <br>
It'll be a long journey, so how about we say farewell before you go? Guardian.
