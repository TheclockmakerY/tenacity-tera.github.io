If you access the Korean servers by 30th June, you can play Last Quest, created by the BHS as a final Goodbye before the live servers officially shut down.<br>
It was confirmed that **Gameforge** (EU,NA,SEA publisher) will **NOT** be releasing this questline themself. <br>
As of writing, they only released translated cutscene from last part of the series of quests.

But honestly, their translated version is as cheap as it can get...
* **You can view translation by clicking** [HERE](#last-quest-cutscene-translation)
* Original version of only last cutscene can be viewed at :

    [Important] Last Goodbyes

    Through the time, many efforts were made to make Arborea peaceful.
    Deep gratitude and reverence for Guardians who made their sacrifice.

    To say a final goodbye to the Guardian, many gathered. 
    Say goodbye to your friends who grew with you first.
    Then please come here for the last time.
    I'll be waiting for you in Velika.


    Click to accept the quest.
    If you accept the quest, the "Last Goodbye" item disappears.

After accepting, you will have to travel to the **Memorial of Elleon Kubel** located in Velika.

    Memorial of Elleon Kubel
    When I looked at his memorial, 
    So many memories came to my mind of us together.
    Our first meeting was hostile...
    ... but he could trust and rely on improvement.

    He was an ally.
    May his soul have a good rest.

*- Jelena walks up to you -*

</center>

    Jelena
    I thought I could meet you here.
    I'm so grateful to see you again in front of his memorial.
    We three together... did a lot of work.


    
    Jelena

    I had a hard time letting him go.
    I didn't know I'd say goodbye like this.
    There were a lot of hard times while I was with you.
    I think there were a lot of things that were worthwhile and happy.
    I'll never forget you and Kubel for the rest of my life.

<center>

*- Reply that Jelena is right. -*

</center>

    Jelena

    I'm going to say goodbye with other people, but...
    I've been waiting for you.
    I wanted to meet you first in a quiet place.
    Because I thought you'd see him before you leave.

    I wish you happiness.
    May adventure and happiness always be with you wherever you go.

Afterwards, you will have to travel to the **Memorial of Paesyn and Zolyn** located in Pora Elinu.

    Little Elin
    Standing here, I'm going to share a happy past and a sad present...
    That's what I think.. and the future that awaits us...
    What will it be?

    May Seren is great to me, to our Popori, and to you. Bless you.



    Little Elin

    Farewell guardian.
    The work of Shiona and Zolyn.. I owe you a lot of things.

    Thank you so much, Guardian.
    By the way, what brings you to Pora Elinu?

<center>

*- Reply that you came to commemorate Paesyn and Zolyn. -*

</center>

    Little Elin

    You came to commemorate Zolyn and Paesyn..
    Why don't you plant a tree for them?
    I'll give you a seedling here.
    Please plant it in the garden outside.
    They will feel your heart and be happy.

<center>

*- Receive seedlings and plant it to the garden outside Pora Elinu -*

</center>

    The branches are swaying in the wind.
    Paesyn and Zolyn soul were greeted in peace.


    Memorial of Paesyn and Zolyn
    Zolyn was cold and chilly, but her will was strong.
    Paesyn was ingenuous but zealous in everything.
    
    When you look at them...
    They smile on their own during every difficult mission.
    If only it hadn't ended in tragedy...
    Their souls forget all the pain and solitude.

    May the happiness be with you.



    Zolyn and Paesyn would be so grateful if they knew you came.
    I will remember you for the rest of my life.
    I wish you peace everywhere.

*- Wish her to stay well. -*

Afterwards, you will have to travel to the **Memorial of Hasmina and Helen** located in Allemantheia.

    Memorial of Hasmina and Helen
    Hasmina, who was with me on the mission until the end...
    My heart aches for her cruel fate.
    Helen... her sister, resurrected by Dakuryon's hands as a subject.
    Hasmina died at Helen's hands.
    
    If you didn't let your guard down and stopped Dakuryon,
    There wouldn't have been a tragedy like this.
    
    I will never forget them.

<center>

*- Quietly pay your respect. -*

</center>

    Fraya

    I thought youd stop by here.
    Im glad you were the guardian of Arborea.

    Did you say goodbye to Hasmina?
    Well, to say goodbye all of a sudden.. I don't know what to say.
    A lot of things happened. It was not once or twice that... 
    ... Arborea overcame a crisis thanks to you.

    I really appreciate it.

<center>

*- Reply that you were only doing your job. -*

</center>

    Fraya
    No matter where you go and what you do in the future...
    ... you will be good at it.

    May the God Karas accompany you on your way.
    
    Are you going to Highwatch now?
    Tell me when you're ready. I'll send you there.

<center>

*- Reply that you are ready. -*

</center>

Clouds of flower pellets are flying through the air and Elins are bowing to you,saying that they will miss you.

### Last Quest Cutscene Translation:

</center>

**Jelena:** You're leaving now? <br>
Thank you. Even though there were hard times, we could overcome them all because you were with us.<br>
Thank you so much.

<center> 

*-People begin to march in-*

</center> 

**Seir:** We heard that you were leaving. <br>
It'll be a long journey, so how about we say farewell before you go? Guardian.

**Kaia:** You are my sword. <br>
Though we will now stand on different battlefields from one another, I will remember you forever.

**Tamur:** I see your steps are waivering, looks like you're still not over us!

<center>

*-The elves appear with their magic-*

</center>

**Fraya:** Some things, even magic can't make easier. <br>
Facing farewell, that is.

<center>

*-Mystel appears-*

</center>

**Mystel:** Chosen One, <br>
Though our fate is to go on separate ways, remember that our hearts will always be with you.

<center>

*-Cheering and fireworks. Velik appears-*

</center>

**Velik:** Now, you're ready to go on a long journey, Chosen Warrior. <br>
It is thanks to you that Arborea could make it this far. <br>
Though we go our separate ways now, the courage and the determination you have demonstrated, in not giving up. <br>
We shall always remember. <br>
We'll cheer for you to stand and continue. <br>
As you make journey in the new world that lies ahead of you. <br>
Thank you for everything, our hero.

<center>

*-Everyone bows, and the cutscene ends-*

</center>

<hr/>

     Seir
     I've always given orders, I don't know what to do for a final farewell. 
     I'm so gradeful for what you've done, Guardian.
     
     Final goodbyes are always so difficult. 
     The Valkyon Federation will be in power indefinitely without collapse thanks to you. 
     Everything we have completed was successful because of you.
     There were many heroes, Elleon and Hasmina both.
     It was you who supported the Federation until the end.

<center>

*- Reply that you were only doing your job. -*

</center>


    As the commander of the Valkyon Federation, I express my deepest gratitude. 
    Without you, Dakuryon would rule Arborea or it would have been destroyed by Manahan. 
    I thank you for your sacrifices and hard work through all these years. 
    I will never forget everything you've done for us. 
    Thank you. 
    Come on, Guardian,may the blessings of the Gods be with you.

<center>

*- You say your last farewell and speak with Godess Velik -*

</center>

    Velik
    Arborea has counted on you. I have counted on you. 
    You have performed admirably and gotten Arborea out of crisis, putting it on the path to improvement. 
    This is the moment of farewell, our final goodbye. 
    I'm so grateful for all the things you have achieved for Arborea. 
    It's going to be hard to meet a hero as valiant as you. 
    
    Arborea has been able to cope with any threat thanks to you. 
    If you weren't there, I don't think we'd be able to be as calm as we are now.

<center>

*- All i did was to protect Arborea -*

</center>

    If you were to listen to the whole of Arborea, everyone would know you. 
    Your name will be remembered forever, even over the decades, your story will be treated as a legend. 

    Arborea will always remember you, forever. 
    Don't forget that. 
    We will miss you.

<center>

*- Reply that you will never forget Arborea and go speak to Godess Kaia -*

</center>

    I never thought this day would come when I would say the final farewell. 
    I express my deeprest gratitude to you, my Sword. 
    
    I must say this before you leave. 
    You were my best Sword, and the most outstanding warrior. 
    My sword shows valor, and is not afraid of anything with combat abilities that no one can match. 
    
    I am very proud to call you my Sword.

<center>

*- Your blessings were a part of me. -*

</center>

    Even now and in the future, you would fight the darkness that many fear. 
    
    It is not easy to say goodbye, Guardian.
    When you were the best Sword there will be. 
    I can't wait to see if you are the only one who will rise to the challenge.

<center>

*- Thank you. -*

The smaller group that previously gathered will now bow.

</center>

Each of them has a unique line of dialog that appears in chat, like :<br>
- **"Well met. May you always be healthy."** <br>
- **"I hope to see you again"**<br>
- **"May you be in good health everywhere, my Sword."**<br>
- **"I will never forget you"**<br>
- **"Goodbye"**.

They then disappear as the screen fades to black.

<center>

#### The time is approaching to leave Arborea.

#### I hope to leave my heart and history here as memories that will never fade.

#### I stopped walking and said goodbye to my friends.

#### Goodbye, Arborea.

Guardian, no matter what happens, you must greet the unknown. You freed me from the Demokron curse, and for that, I thank you. I wish you good luck in your path forward.
