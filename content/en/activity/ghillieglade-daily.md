All Players start in front of the last boss Banyakas. But there are the other two bosses in the back in the original teleport location. <br><br>
If you want to complete the instance the old way, you can go protect both of the bosses before finally arriving to Banyaka.<br>
When you fight Banyaka, there you have to destroy a **red crystal** before attacking Banyaka directly. Reward chest will spawn after fight is finished.

The First boss mission is to protect guardian from attacking mobs until all crystals where mobs spawn break. <br> 
Second boss encounter is to defend second guardian while he recovers. You must attack two teraliths to stun them or draw aggro so they won't hit guardian. 

If you choose to skip the two guardians they get possessed and spawn on sides of Banyaka to do random **stun attacks** (red rings) during boss fight. Also boss fight gets harder and you have to damage boss himself to bring him down to around 30%.

### Tips

</center>

- During boss fight some ghilliedhus mobs spawn. Kill those to get **health motes**.
- On last boss the red crystal has its backside outside, towards player.

When fight is over it's recommended to exit dungeon with command **/reset**. That resets dungeon and bosses to allow second run. <br>
Fastest way to do two runs is to use scroll again inside dungeon, which teleports you back to Velik, after that do **/reset** before entering dungeon again. *This avoids loading Velika city models.*
