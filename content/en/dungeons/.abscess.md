<h3>PreFight</h3>

Just few mobs on the way when you enter the pathway to the first mobs. Nothing special, kill them and move to the first boss.

<h3>First Boss: Thalweg</h3>

Thalweg is equipped with a wide range of attacks, such as lasers, rolls left and right, and damaging circles.

**Stagger Donuts** - Thalweg radiates circles which twice increase their radius causing damage each time and knock down.
* Kaiable/Rallyable. Iframable.

In close combat, he strikes around him in 180Â° arcs from left to right and from top to bottom.
- Occasionally Thalweg also fires a laser at front, causing damage.

Thalweg rolls from side to side or forwards, stream rolling anyone who gets in his way.

In addition, he **summons globulins** at the entrance which need to be defeated. 
- If they aren't destroyed, they produce an **effect on Thalweg which increases his defence** until the globulins have been defeated.

<h3>Bridge</h3>

You will meet several mobs spawning along the way, you will **have to kill them** before attacking the miniboss at the end.

Miniboss generally doesnt require much dps, just kill him and move on to the last boss.

*Tip:* You can skip killing the mobs if your party jumps on to the railing on the side of the stairs near the miniboss. The mobs will lose aggro and disappear, allowing you to instantly start fighting the miniboss.
