(Reduced damage by 80% & Increased damage taken by 100%)

* You should **buy the GEAR ITSELF WITH HALIDOMS & RELICS on the first place** , because they get instantly soulbounded to your character.
  * After those you can make alts for another 5M Bellicarium Credit or just simply do battlegrounds for the rest.

* You can **bank your pvp gear** and then go to your character screen. **Then proceed to make a lvl1 character.**
  * You unbox the lvl 70 box --> use the lvl 70 scroll
  * Once you used the scroll, use your 5M Bellicarium credits. You can open the Bellicarium menu by Battleground matching UI
* After youre done, play with the bear and follow up the hill. Theres a banker with merchant in the tent on left.
